I'm a second year PhD student in Operations Management at at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University (NYU). I am advised by Professors [Divya Singhvi](https://divyasinghvi.github.io/) and [Somya Singhvi](https://somyasinghvi.github.io/). Before joining the PhD program, I studied my undergrad in economics at FGV-EESP and my master's in Statistics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, both in Brazil. Currently, I'm broadly interested in Machine Learning/Stats for data-driven real-world decision-making problems. I'm also interested in the social and decision-making aspects of generative AI.
